Resume Building Browser Card Game

The idea is to build a browser based card game that allows the user to play multiple simple card games. This project is being built from scratch. As of launch, we have no notion of what languages or services we will be using. Research on that front will be recorded on GitHub.

Potentially add multiplayer
Patentailly add 3D
